# IJKLarrows

A Karabiner-like, key remapping utility for macOS, doing the following:
- transforms any Ctrl+I/J/K/L keypress into a Up/Left/Down/Right Arrow keypress. 
- switches the ` and ยง keys

Tested on macOS Sierra and El Capitan.

Usage: compile it with XCode and run the resulting app (with sudo).
